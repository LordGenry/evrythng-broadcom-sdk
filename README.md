# Step by step
1. download official github client (if you donâ€™t have) https://mac.github.com/
2. clone the evrythng-broadcom-sdk (git@github.com:evrythng/evrythng-broadcom-sdk.git). Actually you can use command line to clone the repo, just type `git clone --recursive git@github.com:evrythng/evrythng-broadcom-sdk.git`
3. go to `/path/to/repo/evrythng-broadcom-sdk/WICED-SDK-3.3.1`
4. edit file `apps/demo/evrythng/wifi_config_dct.h` :
Find lines

`#define CLIENT_AP_SSID       "<wifi ssid>"`
`#define CLIENT_AP_PASSPHRASE "<wifi passphrase>"`
`#define CLIENT_AP_CHANNEL    <wifi channel>`
and change it to the settings of your WiFi

5. connect the evaluation board with usb cable to your mac
6. type/paste the next command in terminal in the above directory:

`./make demo.evrythng-BCM943341WCD1-debug download run`

Dominique shared an account (Embedded Devices (?) at dashboard.evrythng.com. You can find a BCM5WCD5EVAL1_3 thing there. Pressing buttons on eval board will update appropriate properties, changing green/red_led properties to true/false will turn on/off the eval board leds. You can delete all of these properties before the demo and it will be created upon board connect (app sends initial values to the cloud on startup).
